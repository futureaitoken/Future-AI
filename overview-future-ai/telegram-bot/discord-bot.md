# ðŸ”¹ Discord Bot

_Discord can be self-hosted or used through the Discord web application. One great thing with Discord is that it has an extensive API for interacting with the server._

_We are developing a Discord Bot to set up your GPT-based chatbot, where it will have the following functions:_

* &#x20;_<mark style="color:blue;">Be empathetic;</mark>_
* _<mark style="color:blue;">Be sarcastic;</mark>_
* _<mark style="color:blue;">Answer specific questions about your own industry (medical, legal, marketing, etc.).</mark>_

_However due to the information power, you will need good computing power for server installation. NLP Cloud offers both GPT-J and GPT-NeoX through an API._

# Unbonded Vaults

Vaults that are open-ended and flexible. You can add and remove your stake and rewards at any time. There is no limit to the number of people who can take part, or the number of tokens an individual can add. As with Epoch Vaults Staking, you can leave your tokens here accruing rewards and they will continue to do so indefinitely, although you will need to manually manage any tokens earned.

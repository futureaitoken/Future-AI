# How to Yield Farm LP Tokens

1\. Click 'Connect wallet' in the top right corner of the portal if you have not already done so. You will then be prompted to unlock your wallet.\
\
2\. Navigate to the 'Yield Vaults' tab located within the 'Vaults' category, on the left side of the screen.

3\. Select the desired vault and then click the 'Farm' button.

4\. Input the amount of LP tokens you want to farm.&#x20;

5\. Click 'Approve' - Skip this step if you have done so before.\
You will be asked to approve the Ethereum transaction and pay the gas fee.\
\
6\. Finally click 'Farm' and confirm the transaction in your wallet. \
Please wait for the transaction to complete, at which point you will see a popup showing the number of LP tokens added and the approximate APY.

7\. To harvest the rewards received simply click the 'Harvest' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

That's it! You are now farming your LP tokens.

NOTICE

After providing LP you are given LP tokens to hold or farm. Depositing those LP tokens in Yield Farming will result in Liquidity not being displayed on the Liquidity page. This will be updated in the future to reflect your actual LP balance while farming LP tokens.

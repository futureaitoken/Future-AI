3. _To create a new wallet, click on 'Create Wallet'._\
   _<mark style="color:blue;">Trust Wallet will propose that the user shares usage patterns - you can accept or refuse - it will not impact your wallet creation.</mark>_
4. _Create a password for your wallet. Choose a secure password, read the Terms of Use and then click 'Next'._
5. _Trust Wallet will remind you: Never share your Secret Phrase (that will give access to your funds) with anyone. Write down your phrase and store it in a safe place. Never in digital format (photo or text).  Click 'Start'._
6. _Click on 'Reveal' to get your Secret Phrase. Write the phrase down, it is required in the next step. When you are confident that the phrase is safely recorded, click 'Next'._\

_Your wallet creation is complete - you can now choose to set Trust Wallet as the default wallet or not._

_Remember, never share your seed phrase or secret key with anyone. Doing so will compromise the security of your wallet and could result in an irreversible loss of funds. Keep your keys safe and secure in an offline location._&#x20;

# 🌐 GPT-3

#### _Have you heard about GPT-3 but haven't quite understood why everyone is talking about it?_

_For a long time we have been hearing that machines will replace us. At first we always think of repetitive, low-complexity tasks that can be easily automated.The tasks have gained complexity and today there is a huge range of complex tasks that are easily done using Artificial Intelligence.Anyway, there are some things that will never be replaceable, because the differential is the essence, that human touch.Or will it be that not even this, not even the tasks that today we consider irreplaceable, will be saved?_

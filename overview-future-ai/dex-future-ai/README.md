# ðŸ”¹ DEX Future-AI

> * _A Decentralized Brokerage (DEX) allows you to trade cryptocurrencies while owning your private key, thus maintaining control of your cryptos._
> * _Other advantages of a DEX include lower fees and potentially enhanced security_
> * _Ledger hardware wallets can be used with many DEXes, while giving you maximum security for your private keys_

#### _Why would I want to use a DEX?_

_Let's start with the most important part: How can you keep your Private Key, but still exchange your cryptocurrencies for another one? Well, with centralized crypto exchanges, you used to have to make an account to log in and use their services. With a DEX, your Private Key counts as your login. Once you log into the DEX with your Private Key, you will immediately see your crypto balances. You will not have to provide any personal information - great for those who value their privacy!_

_<mark style="color:blue;">This doesn't mean that a DEX doesn't come with its own challenges. Let's review the pros and cons of using a decentralized exchange.</mark>_

#### _What other benefits does it have?_

_You are probably aware that traditional crypto brokers handle the exchange of one digital currency for another for you. S<mark style="color:blue;">o what is the difference in a DEX?</mark>_

_It doesn't actually handle the trading itself: it is purely peer-to-peer. This means that the platform is basically there to help you exchange your cryptos with someone else directly, rather than getting involved in the matter. Ok, sounds great, but what does this mean for you? Two advantages: 1. you don't have to trust anyone to make the exchange happen. 2. the fees you pay for trading are generally lower than with normal brokers._

_Finally, let's talk about security. A DEX is decentralized, which means that each person keeps their own cryptocurrencies safe. You don't have to trust the security of your cryptos to someone else - you are completely in control of them._

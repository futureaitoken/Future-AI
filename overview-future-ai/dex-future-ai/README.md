2\. Click 'Connect wallet' in the top right corner of the portal if you have not already done so. You will then be prompted to unlock your wallet.\
\
3\. Navigate to the 'Swap' tab located within the 'DEX' category on the left side of the screen.\
\
4\. Input the amount you want to swap. The interface will automatically calculate the second token's value at the pool's current rate.

5\. Click 'Approve' - Skip this step if you have done so before.

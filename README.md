### Decentralised

Every DynaSet event, from its creation to every subsequent swap, is publicly visible and recorded on the blockchain. This decentralized approach has several key advantages: it ensures that all transactions are transparent and verifiable, it reduces the risk of fraud or censorship, and it allows users to have complete control over their own assets without the need for a centralized authority. Furthermore, the public nature of the DynaSet code means that anyone can review and audit it, adding an extra layer of security and trust.

### Non Custodial

When depositing into a DynaSet, users receive LP tokens that represent their share of the pool. This non-custodial approach means that users retain full ownership of their assets and have complete control over them. This is in contrast to centralized platforms, where users often have to trust a third party to hold and manage their assets on their behalf. By keeping their own keys and managing their own assets, users can have peace of mind that their funds are safe and secure, without the need to rely on anyone else. This also means that users can easily and quickly access their assets whenever they want, without having to go through any lengthy or complicated withdrawal processes. Your keys, your crypto.

### Secured

Every smart contract of the protocol is audited and DynaSet contracts received a 9.7/10 score on security from well known audit firm Hacken.

### Shared fees

By taking part in a DynaSet, the user belongs to a bigger pool with other depositors. This allow the user to share the trading fees as the DynaSet perform swaps from a single smart contract for all its participants.

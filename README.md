# ðŸ“Œ Future-AI | Introduction

_<mark style="color:blue;">Future-AI | introduction</mark>_&#x20;

_Future-AI <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> is a fully decentralized, self-managed wallet protocol where we grant our investors to easily and securely interact with their tokens, all supported by superior risk analysis and smart contract management tools. Our Future-AI protocol is a non-custodial one, where we create a new ecosystem of automated digital asset management that uses AI with analytical data and makes it available to users._

_Our main mission is to use AI and all DeFi technologies to integrate democratic and decentralized properties. We will grant our investors a bot for social networks (Telegram, Discord and Twiiter) and character creation through AI (personalities, voices, bodies, using totally natural language) among other applications that we will grant to our public._

_<mark style="color:blue;">Governance | Future-AI</mark>_ &#x20;

_We have transparency as a pillar of Future-AI, and with that we are developing protocols for feedback and suggestions to our investors, making it a very applicable resource for promoting open and transparent communication._&#x20;
